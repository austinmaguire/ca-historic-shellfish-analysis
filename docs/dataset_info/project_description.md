# Investigating historic fishing trends for common shellfish species in the state of California based on publicly available fish market catch landing data.

Dataset: California Fish Market Catch Landings, Long List, 1928-2002, Monthly
Institution: CA DFG, NOAA ERD
Dataset ID: erdCAMarCatLM

This dataset is made available on the the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) ERDDAP data server (Environmental Research Division's Data Access Program). The data is also provided in conjunction with CA DFG, the California Department of Fish and Game, now known as California Department of Fish and Wildlife.

The California commercial landings dataset contains monthly records of fish and invertebrates caught off the California coast and landed in the state from 1928 to the present. The data, originating from the California Department of Fish and Game, is derived from receipts or "fish-tickets" submitted by markets and packing facilities for all commercial landings. The dataset is organized into six geographic regions based on the port where the catch was landed. It includes a detailed breakdown of species and market categories, with a long list of 336 names that maximizes the distinction between different species while providing scientific names when known. The dataset has some limitations, such as the exclusion of offshore foreign fisheries, tropical tuna fisheries, and post-1971 commercial freshwater catches.
