**Potential Research Questions-**

- For each year in the dataset, what month and port would be the most productive based on landings?

  - Example: If I was looking to harvest shellfish in 1978, what port and species is the most productive?

- Indicator Species Model:

  - Develop a model that identifies leading indicator species
  - Use lagged correlations to find species whose abundance predicts others (incorporate finfish from main dataset?)
  - Create an early warning system for population changes

- Port Specialization Analysis:
  - Cluster ports based on their species composition
  - Analyze how port specializations have evolved over time
  - Identify optimal port-species combinations

**Miscellaneous Questions to Develop-**

- Based on our species of interest, what is the peak season? How does the peak catch port change?

- Are there any migratory patterns we see? Where fish are caught abundantly in the north,
  then more abundantly at Central CA ports, and toward the end of the season in Southern California with catch tapering off in the north?

- When catch of predators goes down does the catch of prey go up?

- Any indicator species for Abalone that might herald better conditions for the stock in the future?
  What catches go down when abalone goes down? What is the probability we are seeing that by chance.

- How have total landings changed over time across all species?

- Which ports handle the highest volume of specific species?

- Is there seasonality in landings for different species?

- What are the trends in commercially important species (e.g., Dungeness crab)?

- How has species diversity changed across ports over time?
