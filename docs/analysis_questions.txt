* Based on our species of interest, what is the peak season? How does the peak catch port change? 

* Are there any migratory patterns we see? Where fish are caught abundantly in the north, 
then central CA, and finally in so cal with catch tapering off in the north? 

* When catch of predators goes down does the catch of prey go up? 

* Any indicator species for Abalone that might herald better conditions for the stock in the future? 
What catches go down when abalone goes down? What is the probability we are seeing that by chance 

* How have total landings changed over time across all species?

* Which ports handle the highest volume of specific species?

* Is there seasonality in landings for different species?

* What are the trends in commercially important species (e.g., Dungeness crab)?

* How has species diversity changed across ports over time?
